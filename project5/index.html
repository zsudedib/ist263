    <p>My first big coding project was an HTML site that replicated the Nike site for a pair of shoes. It involves animation and is heavy in CSS skills. Another project of mine is a sign-in form inspired by a website I use called Splice. Later on, I starting to learn JavaScript and used it to make math-related projects. Below is a simple calculator with a mock logo made with Adobe Illustrator. After than I made a program that approximates the value of PI and Euler’s number, and a program that performs a bubble sort on a list, which is something I did for by ECS class in Python before converting the syntax to JavaScript. Another project I am proud of is one that converts a decimal number to binary, and back to decimal. This was done in Python, as well as the HTML CSS and JavaScript combination.</p>
    
    <p>During our COVID quarantine, I developed what I consider to be a therapeutic hobby which is what is called hyper-realistic drawing, which is where I would spend a very long time trying to perfect one piece of art. My favorite drawing is one of a random model I found online. I only enjoy doing portraits of people…random people at that. I’ve never drawn a self portrait or that of a family member or anything. Some of these are used with charcoal pencils, and some are used with regular pencils, but regardless, I believe they came out decent.</p>
